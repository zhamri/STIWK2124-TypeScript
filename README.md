## Introduction

1. TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, providing enhanced tooling and support for large-scale applications. It was developed by Microsoft and is open-source. TypeScript adds syntax to JavaScript to allow for static typing, which helps catch errors early in development.

1. TypeScript is often used in conjunction with frameworks like Angular and React to build robust and maintainable web applications. It is also suitable for backend development with Node.js.

1. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It is an "extention" to the JavaScript language. The core syntax and features are the same but extra features are added.
